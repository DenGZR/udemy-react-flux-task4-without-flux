Lecture 49: React WeatherApp Component
Task:
Weather Component
You are going to build a Weather component:
-That uses Open Weather Map API: http://openweathermap.org/api
-That shows a five day forecast
-That shows the proper image icons (available via the API)
-That allows the developer to pass in the location they want the weather for
Example images below
Use Fetch to interact with the API (or your favorite HTTP library)
Post your Github link and screenshots to the forums: http://community.devslopes.com/category/33/react-flux-course
Imagine this being a component that any developer could just drop into their website!
There is an OK tutorial on using Open Weather Map API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53AoDB7vcbU

My solution:

Installation:

npm install

Run:

in terminal --> gulp
in web browser --> http://localhost:8888
